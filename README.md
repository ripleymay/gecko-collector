# A simple app for cataloging (pet) geckos!

Gecko-collector is a server based app with **basic CRUD functionality**. Users can see an index page listing all geckos and a detail page of a specific gecko with it's respective tank/terrarium accessories and record of snacks it has eaten. Users can also create, edit and delete geckos and tank items.

This app was built as an intro learning tool to the Django framework and can only be ran on a local server.

## Next steps

Next steps include creating a more appealing UI and perhaps expanding to all reptile pets rather than just geckos (right now the target user audience is pretty narrow!). The app could also be refactored to implement user-centric CRUD functionality using Django's built in User model which would allow users to create login credentials.
